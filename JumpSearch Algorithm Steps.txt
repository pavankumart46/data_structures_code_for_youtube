Jump Search Algorithm

1. Find the Sqaure root of the size of the Array. 
   Set variable "low" to 0.
   (Store the result in a variable, this is going to be the "jump")
   
2. Loop through the array with a gap of jump.

3. check if the current value matches the element we are searching for.
	3.1 if yes, return the index position
	3.2 if the current value is less than the element,
		make "low" value to the current index.
	3.3 if the current value is greater than the element,
		break the loop as the value will be found (if present)
		before we encounter this current value.
		
4. Apply Linear Search algorithm from the current low value till the 
   end of the loop.
   
5. Return -1 if the element is not found
